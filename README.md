# mlt
Machine Learning Container Tool

`mlt` aids in the creation of containers for machine learning jobs.
It does so by making it easy to use container and kubernetes object templates.

![MLT flow diagram](docs/mlt.png)

We have found it useful to share project templates for various machine learning frameworks. Some have native support from Kubernetes operators, such as mxnet and TensorFlow. Others do not, but still have best practices for how to run on a Kubernetes cluster.

On top of getting boiler plate code at the beginning of a project to work, the best practices may change over time. `mlt` allows existing projects to adapt to these without having to reset and start over.

![MLT watch](docs/watch.png)

`mlt` addresses another aspect of the application development: _iterative_ container creation. Storage and container creation is supposed to be fast - so why not rebuild containers automatically?
`mlt` has a `--watch` option, which lets you write code and have an IDE-like experience.
When changes are detected, a timer starts and triggers container rebuilds.
lint and unit tests can be run in this step, as an early indicator of whether the code will run in the cluster.
When the container is built, it is pushed to the cluster container registry.
From here, it is a quick step to redeploy the Kubernetes objects, through `mlt deploy`
