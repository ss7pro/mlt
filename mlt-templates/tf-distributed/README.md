# Distributed TensorFlow MLT Application

A distributed TensorFlow matrix multiplication run through the TensorFlow Kubernetes Operator.

This template requires that the TFJob Operator is installed on your
cluster.  The command below shows an example of how to verify if TFJob
is installed:

```bash
$ kubectl get crd | grep tfjob
tfjobs.kubeflow.org               1d
```

If TFJob is not installed on your cluster, see the installation
instructions [here](https://github.com/kubeflow/tf-operator#installing-the-tfjob-crd-and-operator-on-your-k8s-cluster).
